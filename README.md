# Mystical Realms âš”

Welcome to Mystical Realms, an exciting text-based RPG game written in Python using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. The game is now a full-stack Python Flask app, providing a more dynamic and interactive experience.

## Getting Started

## Gameplay

## Code Structure

The game is organized into three main classes:

- **Hero**: Represents the player character.
- **Enemy**: Represents the adversaries your hero will face.
- **GameLoop**: Manages the game flow, including battles and progression.

## Mobile Improvements

Recent updates have focused on enhancing the mobile experience:

- The layout has been adjusted to fit within a 414px x 796px viewport.
- All elements are centered, providing a more user-friendly interface.
- Padding for hero and enemy stats containers has been reduced for a more compact design.
- The height of the game output has been set to 20vh to ensure better visibility on mobile devices.

## Full-Stack Features

- The game is now built as a full-stack application using Flask, allowing for a more interactive and dynamic gameplay experience.
- Server-side logic is handled with Flask, enabling features like user sessions, data persistence, and more.
